3) What is hoisting and how does it work?


         JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, 
variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. Hoisting allows functions to be safely 
used in code before they are declared.
